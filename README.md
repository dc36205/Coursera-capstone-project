Exploration Well Logs Based On Geological Data for Classification
=================

Brief introduction:

In the activity of exploration of new oil fields, within the life cycle of a project development of new wells, in its initial stage, several crucial activities are required, among them the exploration of the geographical terrain that includes evaluating the characteristics of the geological layers based on its properties and geological formation structure, all this in order to carry out a geological characterization. Due to the prerequisite, small geological samples are extracted from holes that are drilled into the ground at different depths.

With the support of Computational Intelligence Techniques (CIT), the possibilities have been extended to undertake well characterizations more frequently and accurately, making the process of studying these properties more expeditious since it is a task that is expensive to carry out in a traditional way. 

In this project were used two datasets of 24,290 and 12,255 rows respectively, totaling 36,545 records between the two exploratory wells at different depths.
